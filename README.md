# week1
## week1
In conducting the brainstorming process, I set out to clarify my research question in order to choose a more focused direction for exploring wearable devices. By delving into the wearables-related resource sites and papers provided by my mentor, I worked to gain a deeper understanding of the foundational examples of wearable devices and how they interact.

During this phase, I paid particular attention to gathering information about similar products and technologies in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current application scenarios and prospective needs of wearable devices in different fields. By analysing this information, I was able to get a clearer grasp of market trends and user needs, and thus find a more innovative and practical direction in my research.

This stage of work has given me a deeper understanding of the field of wearable devices, providing a solid foundation for subsequent research and design work, and making useful contributions to future projects.

## week2
My focus is on addressing the often overlooked issues related to injuries arising from casual sports activities. Through extensive literature research, I have chosen to specifically concentrate on Achilles tendon injuries, a common tendon injury in leisure sports. Achilles tendon injuries are not only prevalent but also have a prolonged recovery time, potentially impacting subsequent activities.

With a clear research direction, I am targeting users who engage in casual sports rather than professional athletes. In the initial design considerations, I plan to develop a wearable device that meticulously monitors data associated with the Achilles tendon during physical activities. Through this device, I aim to provide timely information about the condition of the Achilles tendon and issue alerts to users in case of potential injury signs, reducing potential risks. Such a design is intended to offer comprehensive health care for casual sports enthusiasts, enhancing their sense of safety and comfort during physical activities.
