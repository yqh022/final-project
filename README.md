## week1
In conducting the brainstorming process, I set out to clarify my research question in order to choose a more focused direction for exploring wearable devices. By delving into the wearables-related resource sites and papers provided by my mentor, I worked to gain a deeper understanding of the foundational examples of wearable devices and how they interact.

During this phase, I paid particular attention to gathering information about similar products and technologies in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current application scenarios and prospective needs of wearable devices in different fields. By analysing this information, I was able to get a clearer grasp of market trends and user needs, and thus find a more innovative and practical direction in my research.

This stage of work has given me a deeper understanding of the field of wearable devices, providing a solid foundation for subsequent research and design work, and making useful contributions to future projects.

## week2
My focus is on addressing the often overlooked issues related to injuries arising from casual sports activities. Through extensive literature research, I have chosen to specifically concentrate on Achilles tendon injuries, a common tendon injury in leisure sports. Achilles tendon injuries are not only prevalent but also have a prolonged recovery time, potentially impacting subsequent activities.

With a clear research direction, I am targeting users who engage in casual sports rather than professional athletes. In the initial design considerations, I plan to develop a wearable device that meticulously monitors data associated with the Achilles tendon during physical activities. Through this device, I aim to provide timely information about the condition of the Achilles tendon and issue alerts to users in case of potential injury signs, reducing potential risks. Such a design is intended to offer comprehensive health care for casual sports enthusiasts, enhancing their sense of safety and comfort during physical activities.

## week3
Before initiating the design process, I conducted a thorough literature review and examined examples of existing wearable devices to confirm the sensors needed for my project. Focusing on three key factors influencing Achilles tendon health, I gathered the following information:

Achilles Tendon Function and Ankle Pronation:
The primary function of the Achilles tendon is to serve as a mechanical buffer, with its hardness increasing as the ankle pronation angle rises. When the hardness is high, the risk of Achilles tendon injury or tear increases with the greater angle of ankle pronation (1). During physical activities, the Achilles tendon undergoes uneven mechanical loads due to sudden accelerations and decelerations, making it more susceptible to tears.

Knee Joint Bend Angle:
The bending angle of the knee joint plays a crucial role in movement, particularly during activities such as running, jumping, and rapid changes of direction. The angle of knee joint flexion can impact the tension and load on the Achilles tendon. Incorrect knee joint angles may increase pressure on the Achilles tendon, raising the risk of injury (2).

Stride Length and Gait:
Stride length and gait significantly affect the load on the Achilles tendon. An excessively large stride or improper step length may increase tension on the Achilles tendon, while a shorter stride weakens the impact force generated at the initial foot contact, especially during movements requiring rapid acceleration or deceleration (3).


In order to capture data pertinent to these three influencing factors, I have opted to employ a combination of stretch sensors, flex sensors, and distance sensors.This sensor fusion strategy aims to offer a holistic dataset, facilitating a nuanced understanding of the interplay between these factors and their collective influence on Achilles tendon health during different physical activities.
