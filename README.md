## week1
In conducting the brainstorming process, I set out to clarify my research question in order to choose a more focused direction for exploring wearable devices. By delving into the wearables-related resource sites and papers provided by my mentor, I worked to gain a deeper understanding of the foundational examples of wearable devices and how they interact.

During this phase, I paid particular attention to gathering information about similar products and technologies in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current application scenarios and prospective needs of wearable devices in different fields. By analysing this information, I was able to get a clearer grasp of market trends and user needs, and thus find a more innovative and practical direction in my research.

This stage of work has given me a deeper understanding of the field of wearable devices, providing a solid foundation for subsequent research and design work, and making useful contributions to future projects.
